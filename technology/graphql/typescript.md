## GraphQL in TypeScript

Packages aimed at combining the type-safety of both GraphQL and TypeScript are quite limited. Currently there are two main opponents:
1. [nexus](http://nexusjs.org/)
1. [type-graphql](https://typegraphql.com/)
Both are fairly new with their 1.0 versions released last year.
